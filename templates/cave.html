  <p>
    This system uses ASR built upon the CMU Sphinx framework to transcribe your data
    and then runs it through automated alignment and extraction using ProsodyLab Aligner and
    FAVE-Extract.

    It also provides the facility to edit the transcripts produced by the speech recognizer,
    and rerun the analysis.

<h3>ASR evaluation</h3>
    <p>   Automated data analysis requires a higher tolerance of potential noise in the alignment and formant extraction results. You can estimate this noise using our transcription evaluation tool, which takes a <strong> manual transcription</strong> of your recording along with the <strong>ASR transcription</strong> of the same, and uses weighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> to compute error rates for words, phonemes, and stressed vowels.</p>
