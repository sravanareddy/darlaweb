<li class="list-group-item"><h3>Bed Word: Automated Interview Transcription via Deepgram</h3>
  <p> <b style="color: red; font-size: larger;">NEW!</b>
    Bed Word is a new tool that utilizes state-of-the-art ASR models to get computer-generated
    transcriptions of audio files. We are currently using a third-party transcription service called Deepgram.
    You will need to 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://developers.deepgram.com/documentation/getting-started/authentication/">
    create your own 
    Deepgram account and API Key 
    </a>
    and provide this information to Bed Word - your uploaded audio will be
    processed through Deepgram to get an initial transcription, then Bed Word will perform the final touches to make the transcriptions suitable for linguistic analysis.
    Your Deepgram account will be charged <a target="_blank" href="https://deepgram.com/pricing/">based on their pricing, </a>  which right now is \$0.75 per audio hour.
    (DARLA is a completely free service, but Bed Word uses
        a third-party company called Deepgram that has its own fee. We do not make any money from this tool.)

<li class="list-group-item"><h3>Audio with transcriptions provided by our in-house speech recognition</h3>
  <p>
    This is our legacy speaker recognition system, which lacks the accuracy of more recent ASR systems. For the best results using automatic transcription, we recommend using Bed Word.
    This system uses ASR built upon the CMU Sphinx framework to transcribe your data
    and then runs it through automated alignment and extraction using Montreal Forced Aligner and
    FAVE-Extract.

    It also provides the facility to edit the transcripts produced by the speech recognizer,
    and rerun the analysis.

<h3>ASR evaluation</h3>
    <p>   Automated data analysis requires a higher tolerance of potential noise in the alignment and formant extraction results. You can estimate this noise using our transcription evaluation tool, which takes a <strong> manual transcription</strong> of your recording along with the <strong>ASR transcription</strong> of the same, and uses weighted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">Levenshtein distance</a> to compute error rates for words, phonemes, and stressed vowels.</p>
