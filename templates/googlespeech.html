<h2>Completely Automated Vowel Extraction with Transcriptions from Google Speech API</h2><p><p>

<p class="lead">Upload your audio file to get automated
  ASR from Google, followed by automated alignment and extraction.
 <p>

<p>Note that automatic speech recognition works much better on connected speech (readings, free speech, etc.) than word lists (sequences of unrelated words).
We suggest manual transcription for recordings of word lists.
